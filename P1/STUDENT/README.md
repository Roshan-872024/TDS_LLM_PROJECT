# 🚀 LLM Code Deployment App (IITM Modern Application Development II Project)

This project demonstrates an **autonomous code deployment pipeline** powered by **FastAPI**, **GitHub Pages**, and **OpenAI’s GPT models**.  
It is designed as part of the **IIT Madras – Modern Application Development II** course, to show how an LLM can generate, publish, and host complete web applications dynamically based on natural language briefs.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The app exposes a single **FastAPI endpoint** (`/handle_task`) that accepts structured JSON requests containing:
- A **brief** describing what kind of app to build  
- Optional **attachments** (CSV, Markdown, JSON, or images)  
- **Checks** that describe what must be present in the final web app  
- The **round** number (for incremental task updates)

Once a request is received, the system:

1. 🧩 **Generates code** using an OpenAI model (`gpt-4o-mini` or higher).  
2. 🪄 **Creates a GitHub repository** automatically under the user’s account.  
3. 💾 **Pushes the generated files** (`index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`) to the repo.  
4. 🌐 **Enables GitHub Pages** to deploy the web app live.  

The result?  
An **autonomously created and hosted web app** — generated end-to-end from just a textual description.

## 🧩 Features

- 🧠 **LLM-driven development** — generates web apps from task briefs.  
- ⚡ **FastAPI backend** — lightweight and asynchronous.  
- 🤖 **Autonomous GitHub integration** — repo creation, file pushes, and page hosting via API.  
- 📦 **Static web app generation** — outputs valid HTML, CSS, and JS files.  
- 🔁 **Round-based workflow** — incremental updates in round 2 and beyond.  
- 🧩 **Attachment-aware generation** — automatically processes Markdown, CSV, JSON, or image attachments.  
- 🧾 **MIT License and README.md** auto-generated by the LLM.

## 🧪 Example Workflow

1. **The instructor (or evaluation server)** sends a JSON task like this:
   ```json
   {
       "email": "student@example.com",
       "secret": "angel_on_earth_2027",
       "task": "markdown-to-html-001",
       "round": 1,
       "nonce": "xyz123",
       "brief": "Create a Markdown-to-HTML converter using marked.js and highlight.js",
       "checks": [
           "document.querySelector('script[src*=\"marked\"]') !== null",
           "document.querySelector('#markdown-output') !== null"
       ],
       "attachments": [
           {
               "name": "input.md",
               "url": "data:text/markdown;base64,SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ="
           }
       ]
   }
